# ATS_Resume_Screening_Analytics

### Project Title:
<b>ATS Resume Screening Analytics</b>

### Project Description:
<p>This project aims to develop a basic analytics tool for an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)
focusing on resume screening. The tool will use Python to analyze resumes and rank them
based on predefined criteria, such as keyword matching. The project is designed to be
beginner-friendly and is expected to be completed within one week.
</p>

### Objectives:
**Data Collection**:
- Collect a sample set of resumes and job descriptions.
- Define criteria for ranking resumes, such as required skills and experience.

**Resume Parsing**:
<style>
    ul {
        list-style-type: square;
    }
</style>
- Use Python to parse the resumes and extract relevant information, such as skills, experience, and education.
- Store the parsed information in a structured format, such as a CSV file or a DataFrame.

**Keyword Matching**:
- Match the extracted information against the criteria defined in the job descriptions.
- Rank the resumes based on the number of matches with the job description.

**Basic Analytics**:
- Perform basic analytics to determine the most common skills, average
experience, etc., in the applicant pool.
- Visualize the analytics results using basic plots, such as bar graphs.

**Documentation**:
- Document the methodology, implementation, and findings.
- Summarize insights and make recommendations based on the analytics results.

**Tools and Technologies**:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK or SpaCy (for text processing)
- Development Tools: Jupyter Notebooks
- Data Storage: CSV files or Excel sheets

### Tasks and Timeline:

**Day 1-2**:
- Collect sample resumes and job descriptions.
- Define the ranking criteria based on job descriptions.
- Set up the Python environment and necessary libraries.
 
**Day 3-4**:
- Parse resumes and extract relevant information.
- Store the extracted information in a structured format.
- Perform keyword matching and rank the resumes.
 
**Day 5-6**:
- Perform basic analytics on the ranked resumes.
- Visualize the analytics results using basic plots.
- Document the methodology and findings.

**Day 7**:
- Review and finalize the documentation.
- Summarize the overall findings and insights gained from the project.

**Expected Outcomes**:
- A basic understanding of resume screening and ranking using keyword matching.
- Experience in using Python for text processing, analytics, and visualization.
- A well-documented summary of the methodology, implementation, and findings of the project.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Understanding: Clear understanding of resume screening concepts and analytics.
- Implementation: Correct implementation of Python for parsing resumes, keyword
matching, and basic analytics.
- Documentation: Comprehensive and clear documentation of the steps taken and the
findings obtained.
